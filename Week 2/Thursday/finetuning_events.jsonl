It has practical value as it can be used for warmth, as a makeshift bed, for protection, as a distress signal, and for its conventional use of drying oneself. Additionally, it carries immense psychological value. If a non-hitchhiker, or \"strag\", discovers a hitchhiker has a towel, they will assume the hitchhiker also possesses other essential items and may lend them any items they might have \"lost\". The presence of a towel thus signifies a hitchhiker's resourcefulness and resilience, making them a person to be reckoned with."}]}
