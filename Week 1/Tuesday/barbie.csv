0,21 July 2023,LoveofLegacy,6," Beautiful film, but so preachy
","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv

2,22 July 2023,Natcat87,6," Too heavy handed
","As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
3,31 July 2023,ramair350,10," As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.
","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
4,24 July 2023,heatherhilgers,9," A Technicolor Dream
","Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv

7,20 July 2023,portraitofaladyonfire,6," Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing

8,24 July 2023,coxaneesa,8," It was depressing
",I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.,/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv

10,19 July 2023,HabibieHakim123,8," Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!
","8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
11,20 July 2023,fscsgxp,6," Amazing Cast & Set, but the political message was too strong
","I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
12,20 July 2023,MissSimonetta,4," The marketing was more entertaining than the actual movie
","I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv

14,4 August 2023,thePopcornExplorer,9," I don't see how it was preachy
","In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
15,23 July 2023,Revuer223,6," Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.
","The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
16,22 July 2023,finnconnelly-63017,10," Ken out of ten
","Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
17,21 July 2023,andermic18,6," No Direction
","The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv

It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers!

20,20 July 2023,Genti25,8," You are Kenough
","This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken.

24,1 August 2023,zkonedog,10," An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun
","For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.",/review/rw9230831/?ref_=tt_urv
